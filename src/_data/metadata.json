  "impressum": "Innovate Trent is an official Trent University club dedicated to critically examining the worlds of technology, innovation, and entrepreneurship through the lenses of multiple disciplines. Do you like talking about relevant, and interesting issues in a fun and relaxed setting... with food? How about working on fulfilling, real-world projects as part of a team? Maybe you're looking to meet like-minded people from many, intersecting walks of life? If you answered \"Yes\" to any of these questions, then we might just be the club you've been looking for!",
  "twitch_intro": "Starting this fall, we will be conducting weekly \"Tech Talks\" covering multiple topics, with both depth and breadth. Bring some insight, and let's have some fun! These will be streamed live on Twitch, so be sure to scroll down and see our previous streams as well as any current or upcoming events, not limited to said \"Tech Talks\".",
  "discord_intro": "If any of this sounds interesting, stop reading this and join our Discord server, already! When you join, you can become an official club member, get access to important insider news, learn about our upcoming events, and be able to chat with other club members who share similar interests. We look forward to seeing you at one of our events, online or in-person! And remember, while many clubs have come and went, nothing is quite like Innovate Trent! (That's right, we're witty, to boot!)"
